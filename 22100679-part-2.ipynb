    "ANSWER: The majority of connections in the entire network are mutual, as the overall network reciprocity is 0.71, which is quite high. Out of the 986 individuals in the network, 408 individuals have a higher ratio of mutual connections than the overall network reciprocity, while 578 individuals have a lower ratio.

Triads with only null dyads connections are the most abundant, accounting for 90.75%. Triads with a mixture of both asymmetric and mutual connections account for 4.01%, while triads with a mixture of null dyads and mutual connections account for 4.91% of all triads. This suggests mutual connections are not evenly distributed across the network with some clusters of nodes exhibiting high mutual connectivity and other clusters exhibiting little or no mutual connectivity."

    "APPROACH: Create a dictionary of nodes and their department attribute using the nx.get_node_attributes(). Group nodes by the department and create a list of department subgraphs with 10 or more members. Calculate the average clustering coefficient and density for each department's subgraph and compare these values to the overall network's corresponding values. Separate the subgraphs into two lists based on whether they are tightly connected or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "JUSTIFICATION: Both measures capture aspects of network connectivity, with density measuring the proportion of existing connections compared to the possible number of connections, and average clustering coefficient measuring how closely the neighbours of a node are connected to each other. Alternative approaches could include using node connectivity or edge betweenness centrality to identify tightly connected subgraphs. However, these measures are more focused on individual nodes rather than the overall structure of the subgraph, and may not provide a clear indication of the overall tightness of connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANSWER: 25 out of 28 departments are more tightly connected than the overall network, while only 3 are not. So, the answer to the question is yes, departments with 10 or more members tend to be more tightly connected amongst themselves in comparison to the overall network."
